# MobileFirst

This project was developed during the course [**Responsive Design: Mobile First Layout**](https://platzi.com/cursos/mobile-first/).

I have made two main improvements for widths of 936px and below:

- Currency and Commission tables are layed out back to back and can be flipped.
- Product cards are put into a carousel.

# Tech stack

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

# Test it out

You can test this [**here**](https://yuneidyc.github.io/Batatabit/).
